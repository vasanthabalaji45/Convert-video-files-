To convert a .mov file to mp4 using ffmpeg, you can use the following command:

ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental output.mp4
This command will convert the input.mov file to an output.mp4 file. The -c:v option specifies the video codec to use, and the -c:a option specifies the audio codec to use. The -strict experimental option is required because the aac codec is considered experimental.

You can also use the following command to specify the desired bitrate for the output file:

ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -b:v 500k -c:a aac -strict experimental output.mp4
This command will create an output.mp4 file with a video bitrate of 500 kbps.

To write a script to automate this process, you can use a shell script, Python script, or any other scripting language of your choice. Here is an example of a shell script that converts all .mov files in the current directory to mp4:

#!/bin/bash

for file in *.mov; do
  ffmpeg -i "$file" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental "${file%.*}.mp4"
done
To use this script, save it to a file (e.g., convert.sh) and make it executable using the chmod command:

chmod +x convert.sh
You can then run the script using the following command:

./convert.sh
This script will convert all .mov files in the current directory to mp4 files.
